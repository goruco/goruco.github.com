<h1>Venue</h1>

<p>This year we are upgrading our GORUCO experience with a bigger and better venue! GORUCO 2012 is going to be hosted at the Altman Building in the Flatiron district of Manhattan. Our new location has over 13,000 square feet of space.</p>

<h2>A Conference for Motivated Programmers</h2>
<p>The Gotham Ruby Conference (GORUCO) is a one-day event that will take place in New York City on <strong>June 23, 2012</strong>. It is a technical conference aimed at highly motivated programmers interested in all things Ruby. You'll spend the day among Rubyists, Rails developers, and language enthusiasts in New York City, home of Silicon Alley.</p>
