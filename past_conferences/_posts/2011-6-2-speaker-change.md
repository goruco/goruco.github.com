As the saying goes, GoRuCo is what happens while you're making plans.
Jeff Casimir and his wife were blessed yesterday with the early birth of their child.
Unfortunately, their gain is GoRuCo's loss, as Jeff will be unable to make it to speak at the conference tomorrow.

Our good friend Paul Dix has offered to fill in with his talk [Indexing Thousands of Writes per Second with Rails](/speakers/index.html#dix).
Be sure not to miss it--the [Thundergod](https://github.com/nodanaonlyzuul/Paul-Dix--Thundergod) never disappoints.
