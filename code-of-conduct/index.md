# Code of conduct

GORUCO believes our community should be open for everyone. We are
committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
religion, preferred operating system, programming language, or text
editor.

We expect all conference participants to help us realize a safe and
positive conference experience for everyone. At all conference venues
and conference-affiliated social events we expect everyone will:

* Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
  conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in
  distress.
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to
  create GORUCO and make it your own.

Unacceptable behaviors include harassing, abusive, discriminatory, or
derogatory conduct. Harassment includes: offensive comments related to
gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate
use of sexual images (including in presentations); deliberate
intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or
recording; sustained disruption of talks or events; inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

These behaviors will not be tolerated and anyone asked to stop is
expected to comply immediately. If a participant behaves unacceptably,
the conference organizers may take action they deem appropriate,
including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.

The GORUCO team is available to help participants contact venue security
or local law enforcement and to otherwise ensure everyone feels safe for
the duration of the conference. If you or anyone else are subject to
unacceptable behavior, or you have any other concerns, notify an
organizer as soon as possible. You can reach us at:
