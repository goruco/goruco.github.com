###Talk Description

A Business Natural Language is a Domain Specific Language where subject matter experts use natural language to represent business logic. For example, a marketing executive for an airline could specify point award descriptions as: "award 1 point for each mile flown where the total flight length is greater than 500 miles"

The above example reads as specification; however, the code is also executable. By providing a language that subject matter experts are comfortable working with several benefits are achieved, the two largest being:

* The business may change its rules without intervention of a programmer
* Programmers no longer need to spend their time trying to represent the logic of a business in lower level languages and can focus on other more interesting tasks
