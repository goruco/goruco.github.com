##Talk Description

The DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) says that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.” A powerful guideline, but it is often heeded without a clear understanding of its underlying motivations, nor consideration for other principles that might lead the code in other directions.

This talk is a sequel to the talk David gave at RubyConf 2010, and will focus on refactorings that we rely on to reduce duplication, and their implications, both positive and negative.
