Traditional data structures like stacks and queues are strict - perhaps too strict. In this talk I will showcase some classical data structures and then provide alternative constraints that will allow our algorithms to achieve a greater level of concurrency.

Examples will include a mix of Ruby and Postgres. Ryan Smith's educational background consists of Computer Science and Mathematics. He has contributed to projects like Queue Classic, ActiveMerchant, Gemcutter and others. These days he is crafting code on the API Team at Heroku
