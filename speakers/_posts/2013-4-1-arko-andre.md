###Talk Synopsis
The story of the quest to make bundle install faster; in which Rubyists around the world inadvertently DDoS [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org), witness its ignominious death, and vow to rebuild it from the ashes stronger than it was before. Then, a tour of the changes; why is Redis so much slower than Postgres? Marvel at the gorgeous metrics and graphs used to measure and optimize; gasp in delight as we track, live, exactly how many Heroku dynos are needed. Finally, a happy ending: today, the server responds to requests TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE faster than it did before.

###Biography
Andr√© Arko has been a Rubyist for 8 years. In that time, he's written a lot of gems, including jquery-rails, and somehow wound up on the Bundler core team. He spends a lot of time excited to be writing in or about Ruby.
