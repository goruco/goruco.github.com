### Talk Description

Archaeopteryx generates MIDI bytecodes which produce music via
prosumer applications such as Propellerhead Reason. If you&#8217;ve ever
wondered whether or not use cases really exist for Ruby features like
lambda, eval, continuations, and higher-order functions, Archaeopteryx
demonstrates not just the usefulness but the power and flexibility of
these techniques. Archaeopteryx also uses statistical AI methods -
specifically, probability matrices, similar to those used in naive
Bayesian classifiers &#8211; to define templates for possible grooves.


An experiment in progress, Archaeopteryx currently generates techno
drum rhythms and New-Agey ambient soundscapes with ease. Developing
additional features by the time of GoRuCo is very, very likely.
Following the pattern of all successful technology projects,
Archaeopteryx targets low-hanging fruit with superior technology, and
scales up from there. This presentation will feature no slides at all,
and focus instead on demonstrations, explaining existing code, and
writing new code live.

### Bio

[Giles Bowkett](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/)'s programming blog is well-read in the Ruby community
and occasionally gets 10,000-visit days. He has worked with Perl, <span class="caps">PHP</span>,
Python, Java, JavaScript, ActionScript &#8211; all the usual suspects &#8211; and
now spends nearly all his time coding Ruby. He&#8217;s worked on the
streaming video site Hulu and contributed a patch to Rubinius, he has
a recipe in the upcoming &#8220;Advanced Rails Recipes&#8221; book, he&#8217;s speaking
at five conferences in three countries in 2008, he regularly checks in
code before 8am on Saturdays, he kind of needs to get a life, and
between December and February 2007-2008 he released 9 open source
projects (with more coming). Giles studies acting with the same
feverish intensity he applies to programming. He also practices
meditation, which, when you consider everything else, is probably a
good idea.
