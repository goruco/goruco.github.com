###Talk Description

Earlier this year we started Hungry Academy with 24 people, most of them with no programming experience whatsoever, and a plan to get them ready for the LivingSocial engineering team in five months. Here's the quick story of what's worked, what hasn't, and the lessons learned as we try to solve the developer shortage.

###Bio

I love to teach Ruby. I'm currently running Hungry Academy, a full-time training program for new developers, in partnership with LivingSocial.

I'm @j3 on twitter and jcasimir on github.
