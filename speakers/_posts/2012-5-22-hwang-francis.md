###Talk Description

<p>
  With the rise of Javascript MVC frameworks like Ember and Backbone,
  web programmers find themselves at a fork in the road. If they keep doing
  server-side web programming, they'll benefit from tried-and-true tools and
  techniques. If they jump into Javascript MVC, they may be able to offer a
  more responsive web experience, but at significant added development cost.
  Which should they choose?

  This talk will address the strategic costs and benefits of using Javascript
  MVC today. I will touch on subjects such as development speed, usability,
  conceptual similarities with desktop and mobile applications, the decoupling
  of rendering and routing from server logic, and the state of the emerging
  Javascript MVC community. I will also discuss the impact of this seismic
  change on Ruby, Rails, and your career as a software engineer.
