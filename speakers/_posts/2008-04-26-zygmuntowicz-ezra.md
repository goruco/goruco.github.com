###Talk Description

Merb is a ruby web framework with a focus on performance, modularity and simple non magical code. In this talk we will explore some of the more advanced concepts of the framework and how it was put together. One of the guiding philosophies of merb is to be transparent and hackable. No black boxes or sausage here, we like to encourage merb users to open up the framework to explore and bend it to their will.
