###Talk Description

JRuby development has been advancing at a blistering pace over the past year, closing in on its goal of being a mature, stable alternate implementation of the Ruby language. Performance gaps with C Ruby are narrowing each week; Rails runs with 90%+ of Rails core tests passing; Java versions of popular C-extension packages such as Mongrel and Hpricot have appeared, showing that JRuby is a viable platform for Ruby applications.

In this talk I’ll present an up-to-date status on JRuby, discuss implementation pros and cons compared to C Ruby (e.g., native threading), and demonstrate an application or two that hit JRuby’s sweet spot, including deploying Rails to a Java application server.
