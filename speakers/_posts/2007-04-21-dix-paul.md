meta: Categorizing Documents in Ruby
desc: Text classification is the task of selecting a class or category for a document or block of text. The canonical example of this is the use of the Naive Bayes classifier for identifying spam vs. non-spam email. Classifiers can also be used for language identification, categorizing news articles or blog posts, detecting trackback spam, comment spam, wiki spam, and more. In my talk I will cover the basics of document classification while focusing on the various tools available in Ruby for each aspect of classification.
