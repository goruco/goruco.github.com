  <h4>Maintaining Balance while Reducing Duplication: Part II</h4>
  <p>The DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) says that “every piece of
  knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
  representation within a system.” A powerful guideline, but it is often
  heeded without a clear understanding of its underlying motivations,
  nor consideration for other principles that might lead the code in
  other directions.</p>
  <p>This talk is a sequel to the talk David gave at RubyConf 2010, and
  will focus on refactorings that we rely on to reduce duplication, and
  their implications, both positive and negative.</p>
  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>David Chelimsky is the lead developer/maintainer of RSpec, and has
  contributed to several other open source projects including Cucumber,
  Aruba, and Rails. He is currently a Senior Software Engineer at DRW
  Trading Group in Chicago, IL. In his spare time, David likes to play
  guitar, travel, and speak something resembling Portuguese.</p>

  <h4>The Front-End Future</h4>
  <p>
    With the rise of Javascript MVC frameworks like Ember and Backbone,
    web programmers find themselves at a fork in the road. If they keep doing
    server-side web programming, they'll benefit from tried-and-true tools and
    techniques. If they jump into Javascript MVC, they may be able to offer a
    more responsive web experience, but at significant added development cost.
    Which should they choose?
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk will address the strategic costs and benefits of using Javascript
    MVC today. I will touch on subjects such as development speed, usability,
    conceptual similarities with desktop and mobile applications, the decoupling
    of rendering and routing from server logic, and the state of the emerging
    Javascript MVC community. I will also discuss the impact of this seismic
    change on Ruby, Rails, and your career as a software engineer.

  <h4>Your Face in 10 minutes...with Macruby!</h4>
  <p>
    In this talk we will build a face detection and recognition app all in Ruby with the power of MacRuby... in 10 minutes! The purpose of this talk is to demonstrate how one can take advantage of Apple API's and Ruby tools to quickly build powerful desktop applications.
  </p>
  <h4>Bio</h4>

He is currently part of the Dailyburn team where he works alongside his colleagues building quality products that help people maintain a healthy lifestyle. He resides in New York City, where he spends most of his after-hours checking out live jazz music, hanging out with other developers/hackers, and participating in various hackfests around the city. Haris claims to have coined the term ‘flauntepreneur’ — someone who builds/hacks on projects just to ‘flaunt’ it to his fellow hacker friends. Not so surprisingly, he is also an obsessive github troll. Haris is constantly regarded by his peers as an evangelist for all things he loves. Ruby trumps that list.</p>

  <h4>Organizing and Packaging Rich Javascript Apps with Ruby</h4>
  <p>
    More and more developers are facing the challenge of organizing and deploying complex client-side Javascript apps. It turns out there are some excellent solutions to this problem bubbling up in the Ruby ecosystem. I am responsible for two complex Javascript applications at Yapp, and in this micro-talk, I will share a solid solution to this problem using open source Ruby projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will cover:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intro to Rake::Pipeline</li>
    <li>This project was recently open sourced by Living Social</li>
    <li>An extension to Rake for dealing with a directory of inputs, a number of filters organized as a pipeline, and a directory of outputs</li>
    <li>Great for describing and executing the build step of a pure client-side application</li>
    <li>Under-documented as yet</li>
    <li>Logical Javascript organization and simple dependency management with mini-spade and Rake::Pipeline</li>
    <li>As rubyists, we love clean, well-organized project directory structure</li>
    <li>Here's how to achieve this for your javascript</li>
    <li>Concatenating &amp; minifying assets</li>
    <li>A solid development environment with Rack, fssm, Puma and Rake::Pipeline</li>
    <li>Puma for using threads to hold requests while your assets are rebuilding</li>
    <li>Bonus: integrate automatic test execution</li>
    <li>fssm for watching your project files and proactively rebuilding assets</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Building Developers: Lessons Learned from Hungry Academy</h4>
  <p>
    Earlier this year we started Hungry Academy with 24 people, most of
    them with no programming experience whatsoever, and a plan to get them
    ready for the LivingSocial engineering team in five months. Here's the
    quick story of what's worked, what hasn't, and the lessons learned as
    we try to solve the developer shortage.
  </p>

  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>I love to teach Ruby. I'm currently running Hungry Academy, a full-time training program for new developers, in partnership with LivingSocial.</p>

  <h4>Power Rake</h4>
  <p>
    Every Ruby developer uses the Rake program all the time, whether to run the database migrations in their Rails project or to just execute their tests.  Some might have even written their own rake tasks to help them perform some menial development task.
  </p>
  <p>
    But Rake has capabilities far beyond just simple task automation. Rake is a fine grained, dependency driven, build tool that knows how to transform files, walk directory trees, and serve you supper. And it does it with the minimal possible effort. (I might have lied about the supper.)
  </p>
  <p>In this talk we will cover the "hidden" features of Rake that are not typically used by the casual Rake user.  We will learn about the convenience of file lists, dynamic generation of tasks, rule based file generation and more.  Come learn about Power Rake.</p>

  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>Jim Weirich first learned about computers when his college adviser suggested he take a computer science course: "It will be useful, and you might enjoy it." With those prophetic words, Jim has been developing now for over 25 years, working with everything from crunching rocket launch data on supercomputers to wiring up servos and LEDs on micro-controllers.  Currently he loves working in Ruby and Rails as the Chief Scientist at EdgeCase, but you can also find him strumming on his ukulele as time permits.</p>

  <h3>Justin Leitgeb</h3>

  <h4>Sensible Testing</h4>
  <p>
    Most Ruby programmers spend significant time writing, maintaining and troubleshooting
    automated tests. While recent discussions in the Ruby community have focused on whether
    we're writing too few or too many tests, this talk looks at how we can write "sensible"
    tests that allow our applications to deliver the most possible value with the least amount
    of development time and effort.
  </p>
  <p>Specific Topics to be Covered:</p>
  <p>This talk will discuss how to test sensibly by trying to answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What should we be concerned about in systems with Ruby and Rails, and how should that guide us to create appropriate test coverage?</li>
    <li>What are the different types of tests, and what type of coverage should we try to achieve for different test types?</li>
    <li>What are signs that a test suite is becoming too large, and how do we prevent this from happening?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In this talk I hope to also demonstrate how writing tests before implementing code helps to shape the architecture of an object-oriented system in a way that may not be achieved by writing tests after a system has been written.</p>

  <h3>Matt Duncan</h3>
  <img src="/images/speakers/mattduncan.jpg" alt="Matt Duncan"/>
  <h4>Scaling with Query Caching</h4>
  <p>At Yammer, we handle thousands of requests per second for pages which consist of private data that varies based on perspective. This perspective makes it difficult to take advantage of traditional Rails caching techniques. To solve this problem, we've moved almost all of our caching to the data layer.</p>
  <p>In this talk, I'll dig into how this type of caching allows us to cache far less data than traditional methods, invalidate fewer records, improve our cache hit rates, and scale to hundreds of thousands of memcache of requests per second with a 98% cache hit rate - all while showing users data differently based on perspective.</p>
  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>Matt is an engineer at Yammer, the leading enterprise social network.  He has contributed to a wide variety of open-source projects and lives in San Francisco.</p>

  <h3>Matt Wynne</h3>
  <img src="/images/speakers/mattwynne.jpg" alt="Matt Wynne"/>
  <h4>Hexagonal Rails</h4>
  <p>
    In the early days of a project, Rails absolutely dazzles.
  </p>
  <p>Tragically, the very same forces that make it so easy to add new features to a brand new Rails application are the ones that start to hold you back as the number of features grows.</p>
  <p>Your test suite gets slower and slower, and refactoring becomes more and more of a chore. Everything seems coupled together, and it's hard to see much of a structure other than the MVC triad.</p>
  <p>In this talk, Matt explains why this happens, and shows you a way out, using a ports-and-adapters or hexagonal architecture to introduce a separation between your application's domain logic, and the Rails framework.</p>
  <p>With practical examples, you'll learn how to apply techniques like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>tell-don't-ask</li>
    <li>domain services</li>
    <li>value objects</li>
    <li>view models</li>
    <li>presenters</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This talk is suitable for advanced Rubyists who want to enjoy the benefits of Ruby's great Object-Oriented and functional programming features in their Rails applications.</p>

  <h4>Deployment - the difference between the 1st month and the next 59</h4>
  <p>When you type "cap deploy", "ey deploy", or "git push heroku master" your intent is to deploy your local application source to your running system on the Internet. That seems to be the point - you changed your code, and you want to Just Ship It. But what is your actual objective? Is it really to just "deploy app code changes"? Is this "app-centric" view and user experience satisfactory?</p>
  <p>Code deployment is your intent on some occasions. On others you want to change your production environments for applications, or change scale attributes of your system, or change how applications and services within a system communicate with each other, or with remote services (such as facebook).</p>
  <p>Is "app-centric deployment" the best mental model and toolchain for shipping changes to productions systems? Or is "environment-centric" or "node-centric", enabled with frameworks like Chef or Puppet, the most powerful &amp; effective model of the system to allow you to deploy and manage change?</p>
  <p>Or perhaps we should describe the entire system - all the apps, all the system dependencies, all the interconnections, all the scale attributes - and command it to come into existence? To command the system to go from nothing to v1 to v2 to v3, where each version includes changes in attributes of the system.</p>
  <p>Where should configuration/manifests/attributes go? Source code files in the config folder? PaaS configuration or environment variables? Or should components of a system dynamically discover information about itself and configure itself?</p>
  <p>Perhaps we need the benefits of a "system-centric" build toolchain, with an "app-centric" user/developer experience to trigger deploys, with a "node-centric" experience for sysadmins.</p>
  <p>In this talk, we will reflect on the current state of deploying production systems, including build/deploy toolchains, and continuous deployment. We'll look at the attributes of a complete system, how we explicitly or implicitly describe them and their relationships, and how to orchestrate changes in the system - from app-centric, node-centric and system-centric views.</p>
  <p>Let's discuss the difference between deployment in month 1 and living with your system for the next 59 months.</p>

  <h4>Why Hashes Will Be Faster in Ruby 2.0</h4>
  <p>The upcoming Ruby 2.0 release contains an interesting performance optimization you may not have heard of before: small Hashes are actually implemented as Arrays!</p>
  <p>In this micro talk, I'll:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>review the basic theory behind hash functions and hash tables,</li>
    <li>show you the new internal data structures that Ruby 2.0 uses to save keys and values, and</li>
    <li>present some performance data that proves this optimization exists and how much time it will actually save you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Do you really need to know how Ruby works internally to be a Ruby devloper? Probably not. But looking "under the hood" is a lot of fun, and someday might help you use the language more competently.</p>

  <h4>Maps want to be free!</h4>
  <p>How to build your own online maps and free yourself from Google Maps limitations and fees.</p>
  <p>Most developers believe that Google Maps is the only way to embed maps in their applications, without knowing that Google will soon start charging usage fees that can make a significant impact on their business models, or that there are license restrictions that might prevent using maps for vehicle tracking, for intranets or behind paywalls.</p>
  <p>The idea of this micro talk is to shine some light on those fees and limitations, to show the audience that there are a few open source alternatives that have become more complete and easier to use in recent years, and that building your own maps is actually not just feasible, but a lot simpler than you would have thought.</p>
