title: GORUCO scholarships sponsored by RubyCentral
author: Cory Forsyth

One of the goals of the GORUCO organizing committee is to have a
 conference with a diverse group of attendees. This year, we are
partnering with RubyCentral to offer scholarships to students who,
because of financial need, wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford to
attend GORUCO.

For the month of April we’ll be accepting applications from students.
 We’ll close new applications at the end of April and notify the
scholarship recipients shortly thereafter. Ten applicants will be
selected to receive a free ticket to the conference.

Interested in applying? Fill out our [application
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1khRLOT2wPVZFjMWCuKBbqtObg9-6F8X0w8julNNmXYU/viewform).

In addition to receiving a free ticket to GORUCO, scholarship
 recipients will be paired with volunteers from the ruby community who
will act as mentors for them, helping to answer questions and introduce
them to other conference-goers. These mentors will also be available to
help answer questions for at-large conference attendees.

Our goals in offering these scholarships are to make GORUCO more
 accessible and to help foster the community spirit among the next
generation of rubyists.

If you know a student who might benefit from this program, please help
 us make GORUCO a more inclusive conference by spreading the word to
them!

If you are interested in helping mentor the next generation of
 rubyists, please contact GORUCO to find out more about becoming a
volunteer! Your job will be to help answer questions and help make
someone (for whom this might be their first conference) a little more
comfortable.
