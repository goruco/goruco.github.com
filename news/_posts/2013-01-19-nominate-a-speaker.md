title: Nominate a speaker

GORUCO speakers come to our attention in a few different ways. Most of
them simply respond to our CFP, but we also invite speakers to speak or
simply to submit a proposal. Over time, we have found that a combination
of the different approaches gives us the best possible set of proposals
to choose from.

When we reach out to people to ask them to submit, we draw on our
personal knowledge of who we think would do well at GORUCO. But of
course, we can't know everybody.

So perhaps you can help us with that. If you know somebody that you
would like to see speak at GORUCO, please use [our nomination
form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGpyS1dkS2VJcTFMc2xxSmxrXzNLTFE6MQ)
to tell us. We'll review each nomination when we make speaker invitations.

Thanks in advance for your help. The more people we have to choose from,
the better program we can offer to all of our attendees.
