This year, the GORUCO party will take place on the 168-foot,
renewable-energy-powered [Hornblower
Hybrid](http://www.hornblower.com/port/yacht/ny+33). Attendees will relax and
take in the New York skyline as the Hybrid cruises around Manhattan.

### Attendee info

Every attendee gets to bring one guest with them on the yacht. Please
make sure your guest meets you at the yacht as they must board with you.

The yacht is docked on the north side of [Pier 40 at 353 West Street at
Clarkson Street](http://goo.gl/maps/PWmh).

Boarding begins at 7:30pm and we will set sail promptly at 8:00pm. You
are responsible for getting yourself to the boat, but you will have
plenty of time to get there.

Dinner and drinks will be served. We will be back on land at 10:00pm.
