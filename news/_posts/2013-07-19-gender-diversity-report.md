title: "Gender diversity at GORUCO: A follow-up"
---

Last year, after we finished GORUCO 2012, we decided we weren't happy
with the [gender diversity of our event][last-years-post]. We took some
steps to see if we could improve the situation. Now that we're done with
GORUCO 2013, this is our report to talk about how we did, what we
learned, and what's next.

### How we did

Based on the numbers, it looks like we did substantially better in women
attendees, proposers, and speakers.

      <th colspan="3" class="groupend">Attendees</th>
      <th colspan="3" class="groupend">Proposers</th>
      <th colspan="3">Speakers</th>

      <td class="groupend decimal_align">-</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td class="decimal_align">11.1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2012</th>
      <td>260</td>
      <td>16</td>
      <td class="groupend decimal_align">6.2</td>
      <td>47</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td class="groupend decimal_align">0.0</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td class="decimal_align">0.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2013</th>
      <td>274</td>
      <td>34</td>
      <td class="groupend decimal_align">12.4</td>
      <td>105</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td class="groupend decimal_align">11.4</td>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td class="decimal_align">21.4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

(Note that for attendees and proposers, counts of women are
fuzzy since we're going by first names. And we seem to have lost our
2011 proposals, so those numbers are unfortunately missing.)

The statistical improvement agrees with our anecdotal feedback: Many
remarked to us that this year felt noticeably more diverse. We even ran
out of women's t-shirts, which is a good problem to have. (If you were
there and didn't get a woman's shirt, [email us at
info@goruco.com][email] and we'll mail one to you.)

### What we did

#### Advisory Board

The best idea we had was to reach out to [DevChix][devchix] and [NYC
Ruby Women][nyc-ruby-women], two
organizations with strong histories of working on gender diversity in
tech.  We held an initial meeting to discuss the issue and then we
formed the GORUCO Advisory Board as a way to keep in contact throughout
the year.

This input was a lot of help.  The GORUCO organizers wanted to improve the
situation, but many of us were not deeply immersed in the issue.  We
learned a lot from the other Advisory Board members and as the year
went on, they helped us get the word out about attending
and speaking at the conference.

The Advisory Board is still around, and we're planning another meeting soon.
If you'd like to help out, you can [request to join
here][join-advisory-board].

#### Giving advice about how to speak at GORUCO

One thing we heard was that some people found the process of getting a
GORUCO talk accepted to be mysterious and intimidating.  In an effort to level
the playing field and demystify the proposal process, we posted tips
about how to improve your odds of getting a talk accepted.  We also
cajoled our good friend [Sandi Metz][sandi] into writing a post about
[how to get over being afraid of public
speaking][what-are-you-afraid-of].  And we participated in a few Google
Hangout sessions where people who were interested in proposing talks
could ask questions and get real answers from some of the organizers. 

#### Student scholarships

In cooperation with the folks at [RubyCentral][ruby-central], we offered scholarships to
ten students who otherwise would not have been able to attend GORUCO.  The main
purpose of the scholarships was to help recipients overcome financial
hurdles to attend, but this also had the added benefit of helping our
gender diversity goals. Of the ten students we selected, six were women.

#### Code of Conduct

Our Advisory Board recommended we adopt a [Code of
Conduct][code-of-conduct].  Although we
had never heard of any serious incidents that would have required one, we
agreed that it's better to be safe than sorry, and to be explicit about
the behavior we expect from attendees and speakers.

A Code of Conduct is yet another way of talking about issues in the open and
signaling to the community that we take seriously the idea of providing a
welcoming environment for everyone.

#### Discount codes

Hoping to encourage people from under-represented groups to attend, we
offered a $25 discount code that we distributed to meetups that served
those groups in the engineering community.  In the end, however, this
code was only used by seven people (some of whom we think might have
attended otherwise), so it's hard to say if this had any meaningful
effect.

### What others in the community did

[Rachel Ober][rachel-ober] organized [RailsBridge NYC][railsbridge-nyc], which offered a free Ruby on
Rails workshop for women and their friends in the days leading up to
GORUCO.  By all accounts this event was a great success, and we're
grateful that Rachel stepped up to the plate.

### What we learned

#### There will be talking

Diversity in tech is a sticky situation: There are no silver bullets 
and there are lots of sensitive feelings.
If you're an organizer who wants to engage with the subject, you will
spend a lot more time talking.  It's time-consuming to meet with people
so you can listen to their concerns, or to write blog posts explaining
your selection process&mdash;and not all programmers like doing this much
talking.
But it is an
important part of the process.

#### Small changes are better than no changes

It is very easy to feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the issue&mdash;after all,
what can one conference do to change things?&mdash;but that's not an excuse
to throw your hands up and do nothing.  By making relatively small
changes, in just one year we managed to have encouraging results and
we're looking forward to even more improvements for next year.

### What's next

We have another meeting scheduled with our Advisory Board where
we'll go over the year's results in more detail and talk about things
might be improved going forward.

If you'd like to join that discussion, you can [ask to join the Board
here][join-advisory-board].
We're going to keep chipping away at this issue.  Maybe you can help us.
