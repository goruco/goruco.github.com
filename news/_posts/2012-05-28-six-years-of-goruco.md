### Hey, let's put on a show

Let me make a confession: Before we hosted the first GORUCO, I kind of didn't want to be bothered. [NYC.rb](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/) had been a successful Meetup for years, and people would occasionally say "you know, we could have a great regional conference here." Which made sense in theory, but just thinking about the work involved gave me a headache. I usually smiled politely and tried to change the subject.

Eventually, some of my fellow co-organizers convinced me to do it, and we hosted our first event in the spring of 2007. I don't think any of us had organized something on this scale before, and, as feared, it was pretty exhausting.

But on the evening after the conference, hanging out at the party, I didn't feel especially tired. A lot of people kept telling us what a great time they had. And maybe they were just being polite, but I kept thinking that we had something. I was already hatching plans for year two.

Because New York City is the best city in the world, and it deserves
more great hacker conferences. And maybe I was fooling myself, but it
seemed like we had one of those on our hands.


### The GORUCO formula

It's not exactly a secret that [New York doesn't have many good hacker conferences](http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/01/developer-conferences-in-nyc.html).
 Sure, it has industry events that flirt with tech. It has startup events where people looking for funding walk around saying "disruptive" a lot. It has corporate events where ex-coders who've moved into middle management can get the most out of their expense accounts. But when it comes to the full-on techie conference experience, by hackers and for hackers, there's not much going on.

So we looked at the price of real estate, and we looked at the programmers we were trying to serve. And we structured GORUCO around a specific hypothesis: That our attendees aren't just hackers; they're also New Yorkers. They have less time to hang out at conferences, and for some of them, more isn't necessarily better. They value quality over quantity, and not enough events are planned with that in mind.

That's why we have a one-day, one-track format. Rather than bring our attendees two good days of talks, we'd rather bring them one amazing day. We pay a meaningful honorarium to our speakers--far more than most other techie conferences--so we can choose from the widest range of speakers from around the globe. And then we plan the living hell out of it.

All of which is, I think, why we've sold out every year. And why people tell us, in person or on their blogs or on Twitter, that GORUCO is their favorite tech conference. Because their time is valuable, and we treat it that way.

### Stepping it up

When we started planning this year's event, we decided we needed a bigger venue. For years, the good people at [Pace University's Seidenberg School](http://www.pace.edu/seidenberg/)
 were kind enough to host us, but unfortunately they can't host a bigger crowd, which is part of why we'd routinely sell out in less than a week.

This year, we've moved to the [Altman Building](http://www.altmanbldg.com/), a top-notch event space in the Flatiron district. We're thrilled to be able to host more of our friends and colleagues this year. Not only does it mean that getting a ticket is easier, but it means there are more people to catch up with at lunch, or between talks, or at one of the events before or after the conference itself.


In addition, we redoubled our efforts to craft a great program, and [the results speak for themselves](/speakers/). We have a program that's packed with stars, including [David Chelimsky](/speakers/2012/05/22/chelimsky-david.html), [Jim Weirich](/speakers/2012/05/22/weirich-jim.html), and [Dr. Nic](/speakers/2012/05/22/williams-nic.html). We've been proud of our lineup every year, but this could be our best yet. You can find other events with speakers this good, but none that you can get to on the subway.

### So, why go?

If you've never been to GORUCO before, now's a great time to start. You get possibly the best lineup of any New York hacker event this year. You get a conference that is planned by a group of hard-working organizers with an established track record. And you also get--

(Well, there's one other surprise I'd love to let you in on right now, but apparently _some organizers_ feel that we should wait 'til we're properly prepared to talk about it. So that one will have to wait for now. Razzafrazzin' co-organizers.)

All in all, you get an inspirational, mind-expanding hacker conference, all without having to leave the greatest city in the world. [Won't you join us?](http://bit.ly/goruco-2012-registration)
