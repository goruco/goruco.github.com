title: GORUCO now has a code of conduct
author: Francis Hwang

When we [started to speak to community members about
diversity](/news/2012/goruco-and-gender-diversity/), one thing
we learned is that having a publically posted code of conduct can make a
difference. We have never heard of any specific incidents that
would've made GORUCO a hostile environment for anyone. But the feedback we
received is that having an official policy can help by signaling an
intent to keep things that way.

So starting this year, GORUCO has a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/). It's adapted from
the [Open Source Bridge Code of
Conduct](http://opensourcebridge.org/about/code-of-conduct/) (and itself licensed under
[Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)). And it includes personal
contact info for a few organizers, so in case you do end up dealing with
unacceptable behavior, you can contact us for immediate help.

It's our humble opinion that GORUCO has always been an event that is
welcoming to people from different backgrounds. We wouldn't expect any
less from our attendees. And we're happy to formalize and publicize that
expectation.
