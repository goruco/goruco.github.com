<h1>Yacht Party</h1>

<p>
  We're incredibly excited about this year's GORUCO afterparty, and expect it to
  be the best yet. Much fun was had by all aboard the GORUCO boat party last year,
  so this year we're continuing that tradition but stepping it up.
</p>

<p>
  This year's afterparty is a two hour cruise around New York City aboard the
  new Hornblower Infinity 210 foot yacht. The boat cruise will feature
  an open bar as well as light food.
  <strong> All GORUCO attendees receive admission to
  the boat party for themselves and a guest.</strong>
