The Flatiron school is a full time immersive program that trains web developers. We learn the entire ruby stack and focus heavily on collaboration. Our students are active in the developer community, presenting at meetups, maintaining active technical blogs and contributing to open source (just ask our recent Alum, Matt Salerno- the guy giving the Ruby Motion talk). We learn from the best- guest lecturers include Yehuda Katz, Peter Cooper, Laurent Sansonetti, Zach Holman, Steve Klabnik, and other heroes.  We've had 100% job placement at companies ranging from Art.sy and Cyrus Innovation to Conde Nast and New York Times.
